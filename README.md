****This is a mix of C, HTML, And some imagination.****

Who For?
--------

Well, its for people who know the C/C++ programming language. \
But they also want to create WEBSITES. \
They have the design in their head, but they don't want to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. \
Instead, they will use this. A bit diffrent, but its far from HTML, but with the same concepts as HTML, with a bit of C. \
(BTW THIS IS LIKE ME LOL)
